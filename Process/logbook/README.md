  > Most of the times the commits were only made during Wednesday because it's the only time we have robotics class

## October
During October, we had read the rules in order to view what we should do (we didn't start until January becouse until that month the rules weren't updated), we also learnt how to use git and created this repository.

## November
In November we were still learning how to manage git by making a script with random library in three different branches and then merging them.

## Dicember
During Dicember, we had learnt how to use the PiCamera and we also finished the programm.

## January
In January we made the connections and we alredy had the competition rules, so we divide the work and we had created scripts for the engine and for the camara, but the last one didn't work well.
## February
During February, we had learnt how to manage a readme, we created the first car model, we improve the engine script too, we create our logo.
## March
In March, we did some test such as GPIO, ultrasounds, servos, camera with the library PiCamera 2, that we later removed due to malfunction; we did the first attempt of the main code too, we also had updated the stl files of our car models and improved a little bit the Readme's.
## April
During April, we essentially learnt how to work with Open CV due to the malfunction of the camera I had mentioned before.
## May
In May, we created a camera version that finally works well, we done our first version of the parking, we improved the first version of the main code too and we clean the code making the main code able to access a new folder where we keep all the functions used in the main.

At this time one mate joined to us but another one left us.
## June
During June, we solved some bugs, created a new car model, we also added a tcs34725 (a color detector) and changed again the main codes according with the cleaner code system.
## July
In July, we reworked the main code, making it work in threads, a more optimized way, we also changed some readme, and refactored the files.
