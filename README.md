This vehicle is based on various electronic components that are the following: a raspberry pi 4 model B, it has 4 ultrasonic sensors (one front, one rear, one on the left, one on the right), a 180 degree servo rotation to control direction and another 360 degree rotation to control traction, a 10 kilohom resistor, a pull down button, a prototyping plate (protoboard); as components made of plastic.
